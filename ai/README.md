# AI

## AI types
* Linear Regression 
    * finding relationship between input and output variables
* Deep Neural Netowrks
    * networks with hidden layers between input and output
    * speech, image recognition and natural language processing
* Logistic Regression
    * ML model similar to Linear Regression for solving binary classification problems
* Decision Trees
    * used to arrive at consclusion based on the data from past
    * applicable for both, regression and classification problems
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
    * branch of Logistic Regression Model
    * used when two or more classes are to be separated in the output
* Naive Bayes
    * based on Bayes Theorem and applicable for test classification
    * used in medical data classification and spam filtering
* Support Vector Machines
    * quick and efficient, analysis limited amounts of data
* Learning Vector Quantization
    * works on winner-takes-all principle.
* K-nearest Neighbors
    * simple supervised ML model assuming similar things (data) exist near each other
* Random Forest
    * forest with multiple decision trees, each trained on different data merging results with more accurate predictions

## AI applications
* Healthcare diagnosis
* Gaming (NPC intelligence, game play)
* Finance (automtion, chatbot, addaptive intelligance, algo trading, ML for financial processes)
* Data security (AEG bot, AI2 Platform), bugs detection and attack strategies
* Social media (mostly harmful)
* Travel and Transport - chatbots and suggestions
* Automotive Industry - virtual assistant, self-driven cars
* Robotics - specific tasks training
* Entertainment - recommendation
* Agriculture - robotics, crop monitoring, predictive analysis
* E-commerce - recommendations
* Education - chatbots, personal virtual tutors 
* IT - code generation
* Art - art generation
